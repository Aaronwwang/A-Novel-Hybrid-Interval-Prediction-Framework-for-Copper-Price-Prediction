This repository contains the source code accompanying our research （A Novel Hybrid Interval Prediction Framework Integrating Multiobjective Optimization and Quantile Deep Learning for Copper Price Prediction）. The current version provides the core implementation of the proposed forecasting framework. We will continue to improve the codebase, add detailed usage instructions, and enrich the documentation as part of the README in subsequent updates.
